To start a tiny instance running RHEL 6.4 and a t1.micro instance
aws ec2 run-instances --associate-public-ip-address --image-id ami-a25415cb  --security-group-ids "sg-306ba155" --instance-type "t1.micro"  --subnet-id "subnet-6581af23" --count 1 --key-name welkere

To connect to the machine created:
* make sure that your private key has limited permissions (600, for read/write for me only)
* ssh -l ec2-user -i welkere.pem <public ip>

To add packages, 'sudo yum install git', for instance.


pip install ansible
